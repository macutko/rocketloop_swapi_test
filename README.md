# RUN

To run this project either start each project inividually or just run the `docker-compose up`. The backend has a few tests to run using the `tests.sh`. 

# TODO

- Need to make the CharacterItem component clickable to open a CharacterInfo modal
- Make CharacterInfo modal query the backend to get the extra details to display
- add tests to the backend (especially serializers)
- add tests to frontend to make sure that error handling is working well for the UX
